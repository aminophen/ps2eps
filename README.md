ps2eps - calculate correct bounding boxes for PostScript and PDF files

## Description
	ps2eps is a tool (written in Perl) to produce Encapsulated
    PostScript Files (EPS/EPSF) from usual one-paged Postscript
    documents.  It calculates correct Bounding Boxes for those EPS
    files and filters some special postscript command sequences that
    can produce erroneous results on printers. EPS files are often
    needed for including (scalable) graphics of high quality into
    TeX/LaTeX (or even Word) documents. Included graphics can be 
	clipped to their bounding box.
	
	Nowadays PDF is more widely used, but the original problems
	described below still exist: pdfcrop sometimes does not 
	produce the correct bounding box. This program can be used 
	together with pdfcrop in order to produce reliable bounding 
	boxes for PDF files, too.
	
	Other programs like ps2epsi do not calculate the bounding box 
	always correctly (because the values are put on the postscript
    stack which may get corrupted by bad postscript code) or rounded 
	it off so that clipping the EPS cut off some part of the image.
    ps2eps uses a double precision resolution of 144 dpi and appropriate 
	rounding to get a proper bounding box. The internal bbox device of 
	ghostscript generates different values (sometimes even incorrect), 
	so using the provided bbox should be more robust.
    However, because normal clipping has only a resolution of 1/72dpi 
	(postscript point), the clipping process may still erase parts
	of your EPS image. In this case please use the -l option to add 
	an additional point of white space around the tight bounding box.

## Documentation

	Please see documentation in the manpage or doc/ sub directory.
	Note that the manpage may have an older version number in it,
	which is nothing to worry about since there may have been minor
	changes incorporated into ps2eps not requiring any update of the
	documentation.
